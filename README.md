# robotics_tools
A set of tools related to learning up robotics, programmed for my own education primarily, but also may be useful as examples for others!



## So far, here is a list of planned features
* Plotting tools 2D polygon bots
* Separating Axis Theorem collision checker (SAT, only for convex polygons)
* Some implementation of trying to solve the concave or convex hull problems
